**Email Phishing**
 _What is email phishing? ‚öì_
Email phishing is a type of cybercrime where attackers send fraudulent emails disguised as legitimate messages in order to deceive recipients into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal details. Phishing attacks typically involve social engineering techniques to create a sense of urgency or trust, enticing users to click on links or download attachments.

_Common Characteristics of Email Phishing üßê_
1.	Sender Impersonation: Attackers often use email addresses similar to those of legitimate organizations.
2.	Urgent Language: Emails may create a false sense of urgency, urging the recipient to act quickly.
3.	Suspicious Links and Attachments: Links may direct users to fake websites, and attachments may contain malware.
4.	Generic Greeting: Many phishing emails use generic salutations like "Dear Customer," indicating they may not be personalized
ÔÉò	Preventive Measures‚öíÔ∏è
1.	Verify the Sender: Always check the email address and look for inconsistencies.
2.	Do Not Click Links: Hover over links to see where they lead before clicking.
3.	Use Security Software: Install and maintain updated antivirus and antimalware software.
4.	Educate Yourself and Others: Learning about phishing tactics can help you recognize potential threats.

_Example to identify the Phishing mail_
I came across this image recently üëá and it‚Äôs a perfect reminder of how sophisticated online scams have become.

At first glance, both of these email addresses look identical:
üìß noreply@microsoft.com
üìß noreply@micros–æft.com

But looking closer, you'll realize that the second one uses a Cyrillic ‚Äú–æ‚Äù, not an English ‚Äúo‚Äù Also, the second one contains capital letter 'i' instead of letter 'l' (L).

These tiny differences can be impossible to spot, and that‚Äôs exactly what scammers rely on.

This type of trick is called a homograph attack, and it‚Äôs one of the easiest ways to get people to click a fake link or share sensitive information.
